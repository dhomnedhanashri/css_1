    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</li><br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li><br>
        <li><span class="dh">Css is not neccesary</span>
             <span class="dd"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can
            control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li><br>
        <li>External stylesheet are stored in CSS files.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documentsin 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.
        </li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section.</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="ad"> in
                this tutorial we will user inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and
            easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies to multiple elements. ID, on the other
        hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link
        directory to an element and it's used by javascript.</p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has
        been tergeted, a style or set of styles can be appied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to
        target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
